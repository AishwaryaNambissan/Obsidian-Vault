LLaMA is a collection of foundation language models ranging from 7B to 65B
parameters. For a given compute budget, the best performances are not achieved by the largest models, but by smaller models trained on more data. 

Meta and Microsoft have partnered to expand Llama 2 on Azure and Windows so that developers and organizations can build AI powered tools and experiences. Open and frontier models are supported and developers can choose the type of model they wish to work with.
Developers can now utilize Azure AI's advanced features for model training, fine-tuning, inference, and AI safety through the availability of the Llama 2 models. By incorporating these models into Windows, it enhances the platform as the ideal choice for developers to create personalized AI experiences for their customers. This integration also allows developers to leverage powerful tools such as Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), Windows terminal, Microsoft Visual Studio, and VS Code.

Llama 2 has also been integrated into HuggingFace, Â a French-American company that develops tools for building applications using machine learning.  Llama 2-Chat is likely to be the best open source chatbot. The features accessible now are:

- Transformers integration
- Text generation inference
- Models on the hub
- Examples to fine-tune the small variants of the model with a single GPU
- Integration with Inference Endpoints
